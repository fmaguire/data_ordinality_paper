## Data Ordinality {.page_break_before}

Errors in the transmission and recording of medical information is a major source of adverse medical outcomes [@doi:10.1111/medu.13821].
These data errors can have wide-ranging impacts beyond the patient directly affected because most clinical research involves analysing patient chart data [@pmid:8599488,@pmid:23793682].
Therefore, this can lead to erroneous study outcomes [@pmid:18390166] and subsequent harmful incorrect changes to standards of care.

As the number of people involved in communicating a piece of data increases, it is more likely that the data will accrue errors.
An intuitive example of this is the "whisper game".
In this, a message is whispered from person to person and becomes increasingly distorted in the process.
Medical information, which is shared between large networks of people over extended periods of time, is particularly prone to these types of distortions. 
Minimising the number of error-prone human links in data transmission is the easiest way to mitigate this kind of data error.

To help clinicians understand and make use of this idea we present the concept of "data ordinality".
Ordinality denotes the order of objects within a sequence, e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd.
When applied to data, we can use it to describe how many times a piece of data has been manually recorded or entered into a system.
For example, 1st order data could be a temperature on a thermometer, 2nd order would be this temperature value when recorded in a chart, and 3rd order would be a researcher extracting the data.
In our "whisper game" example, data ordinality increases each time the message is whispered. 
Similarly, errors increase as data ordinality increases in the clinical and research setting.

While most researchers, hospital administrators, and clinicians will implicitly understand data ordinality, we believe explicitly codifying this concept is integral to patient safety, system design, and research integrity.
By thinking about data ordinality, the utility and importance of interventions, such as clinical information technology, that dramatically decrease the role of error-prone humans in data transmission becomes more obvious.
Without a clear concept, it is harder to build these ideas into the design of clinical systems and research protocols. 
Ultimately, we believe that the data ordinality offers a fundamental informatics framework that will prevent the medical "whisper game" and help clinicians to advocate for systems that minimise data error in practice and research.
